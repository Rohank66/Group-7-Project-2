## Description of Dataset:

Our dataset captures data on mental health readmissions in New York State from 2014 to 2021. The dataset was sourced from the New York State government’s open data portal (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-readmission-beginning-2014). It specified various dimensions with multiple data types to provide a comprehensive view of mental health readmissions across different groupings and demographics. The metric description identifies the specific metric being recorded, and the grouping level is a numeric identifier for the level of data aggregation (state-wide or more localized). The region or coverage category lists several different coverage types, and their regions. In this case, the unique identifiers are Statewide, FFS (Fee-for-Service), HARP (Health and Recovery Plan), HIV SNP (HIV Special Needs Plan), Mainstream, New York City, and Rest of State. The age inpatient type is a string datatype categorizing patients by age and the type of facility, providing insight into different patient demographics. The year, numerator, denominator, YTD numerator, and YTD denominator data sets provide the year of the data record and quantitative values for calculating readmission rates. They are later used to calculate the rate and YTD rate fields showing the proportion of readmissions relative to the total discharges, based on specific quarters. These various dimensions allow for an analysis on trends, demographic breakdowns, and regional comparisons. This can lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of mental health readmissions, identify areas of concern, and track the effectiveness over time. 

## Question 1:

Question Asked: How have mental health readmission coverage plans evolved over time between New York City and the rest of the state, particularly concerning readmission within 90 days?

Importance??
