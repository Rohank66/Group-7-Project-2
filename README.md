## Description of Dataset:

Our dataset captures data on mental health readmissions in New York State from 2014 to 2021. The dataset was sourced from the New York State government’s open data portal (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-readmission-beginning-2014). It specified various dimensions with multiple data types to provide a comprehensive view of mental health readmissions across different groupings and demographics. The metric description identifies the specific metric being recorded, and the grouping level is a numeric identifier for the level of data aggregation (state-wide or more localized). The region or coverage category lists several different coverage types, and their regions. In this case, the unique identifiers are Statewide, FFS (Fee-for-Service), HARP (Health and Recovery Plan), HIV SNP (HIV Special Needs Plan), Mainstream, New York City, and Rest of State. The age inpatient type is a string datatype categorizing patients by age and the type of facility, providing insight into different patient demographics. The year, numerator, denominator, YTD numerator, and YTD denominator data sets provide the year of the data record and quantitative values for calculating readmission rates. They are later used to calculate the rate and YTD rate fields showing the proportion of readmissions relative to the total discharges, based on specific quarters. These various dimensions allow for an analysis on trends, demographic breakdowns, and regional comparisons. This can lead to a better understanding of the dynamics of mental health readmissions, identify areas of concern, and track the effectiveness over time. 

## Question 1:

Question Asked: How have mental health readmission coverage plans evolved over time between New York City and the rest of the state, particularly concerning readmission within 90 days?

## Question 2:

Question Asked: How does the mental health readmission rate differ by coverage type, and are there specific coverage types with significantly higher or lower rates?

Importance: 

This question is important because it highlights the differences in mental health readmission rates and enables the public to be aware of the coverage types that are most likely to have adults readmitted for mental health reasons. With this information, insurance plans may decide they need to allocate more mental health coverage plans and resources.

This graph shows:

The heat map depicts the change in mental health readmission rates for each coverage type and highlights the change in rates per coverage type through a color gradient, with a darker hue denoting a higher rate and a lighter hue denoting a lower rate. Between 2015 and 2020, the statewide coverage rate decreased as the heat map shows a lighter color in 2020 in comparison to the color in 2015. 

After creating the first heatmap to depict readmission rates in 2015, we decided to delve deeper into what the regional readmission rates would look like in 2020.  Between 2015 and 2020, the statewide coverage rate decreased as the heat map shows a lighter color in 2020 in comparison to the color in 2015. Here we also noticed that HARP-New York City, HARP, and HARP- REST OF STATE had significantly higher rates in 2020 compared to 2015 when it had virtually no usage.
